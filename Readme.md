# Run instruction for Golang Broadcast Chat

```bash
make deps
make build
make run
```
Run these 3 commands in one terminal -- server will open up

Then open up another terminal instance and do:

```bash
telnet localhost 8080
```
You can use this same command to run multiple users
Then follow the instr on the terminal

Please watch the video - its about 18 minutes and very fun to code along with.
